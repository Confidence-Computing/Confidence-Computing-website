    quote: `IT professionals typically speak in terms not easily understood by those of us outside the field. It was my experience that Evan possesses a unique ability to explain complex IT issues in very simple terms (which, as a marketing director, is important to me). He was very eager to address my IT requests and would go out of his way to walk me through the process. I am more knowledgeable about how to integrate IT with marketing as a direct result of my interaction with Evan.`,
