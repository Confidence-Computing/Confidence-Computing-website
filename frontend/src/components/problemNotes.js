  heading: "When your computer feels unpredictable",
  intro:
    "Technology can shift without asking. What felt familiar yesterday may look different the moment you sit down. Buttons move, warnings appear, and the screen you trust seems to change the rules.",
  context:
    "It can feel like the updates arrive faster than you can keep up. That pace builds pressure, fatigue, and the sense that you are chasing every notification just to stay where you started.",
  questions: [
    "Does your computer behave differently each time you start it?",
    "Have updates switched buttons you depended on?",
    "Do new warnings or popups make you nervous about what is safe to click?",
    "Are you afraid of losing the photos, documents, or emails you care about?",
    "Do you feel pressure to keep up with every change faster than you can learn it?",
  ],
  reassurance:
    "You are not alone. Plenty of people reach out once their system shifts without warning. You do not need to chase every update, scam, or fresh setting by yourself.",
};
