    "Technology does not ask if you are ready before it changes. One day everything looks familiar. The next day there are new buttons, new warnings, and new things asking for your attention. It can feel like the conditions on your screen are always shifting.",
  questions: [
    "Do you feel like your computer behaves differently every time you turn it on",
    "Have updates changed how things look or moved buttons you used to rely on",
    "Do new warnings or popups make you nervous about what is safe to click",
    "Are you afraid of losing photos, documents, or emails you care about",
    "Do you feel pressure to keep up with technology that seems to change faster than you can learn it",
  ],
  reassurance:
    "You are not alone in feeling this way. Many of our clients come to us after trying to live with a computer that seems to change the rules without warning. It is normal to feel overwhelmed by that. You are not expected to keep up with every update, every new scam, or every new setting by yourself.",
