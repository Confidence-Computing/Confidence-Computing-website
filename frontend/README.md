# Frontend Workspace

This folder hosts the emerging frontend for the Confidence Computing site. It is currently focused on structural scaffolding so future visual work stays organized.

- `public/` contains entry HTML and assets required for static hosting.
- `src/` holds component, layout, sections, and style code.
- `package.json` (when added) should document tooling and scripts for this frontend.

Keep this space tidy: add descriptive README updates whenever you expand the scaffold.
