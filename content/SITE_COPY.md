## 2. Problem and Empathy Section

**Section heading**  
When your computer feels unpredictable

**Intro paragraph**  
Technology does not ask if you are ready before it changes. One day everything looks familiar. The next day there are new buttons, new warnings, and new things asking for your attention. It can feel like the conditions on your screen are always shifting.

**Relatable questions**  

- Do you feel like your computer behaves differently every time you turn it on  
- Have updates changed how things look or moved buttons you used to rely on  
- Do new warnings or popups make you nervous about what is safe to click  
- Are you afraid of losing photos, documents, or emails you care about  
- Do you feel pressure to keep up with technology that seems to change faster than you can learn it  

**Reassurance paragraph**  
You are not alone in feeling this way. Many of our clients come to us after trying to live with a computer that seems to change the rules without warning. It is normal to feel overwhelmed by that. You are not expected to keep up with every update, every new scam, or every new setting by yourself.

## 3. How We Help - Services Overview

**Section heading**  
We bring calm to your changing technology

**Intro paragraph**  
Whether your computer has suddenly slowed down, started showing new warnings, or simply does not feel trustworthy anymore, we focus on stabilizing things and protecting what matters most to you.

### Service 1 - Repairs, Tune ups, and Replacements

Is your PC making new noises, running slowly, or freezing at the worst times  
We give your computer a careful tune up, clearing out clutter and checking for problems so it runs more smoothly and reliably. If it is time for a replacement, we help you choose a new computer that fits your needs and budget, and we set it up so it feels familiar instead of foreign. We can also help you upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 without losing your information or your sense of control.

### Service 2 - Data Backup and Recovery

When technology changes or devices fail, the biggest fear is losing what cannot be replaced. We help you protect your photos, handwritten recipes, important documents, and emails so they stay safe and easy to reach. If something has already gone missing, we do our best to recover it and explain what happened in clear, honest terms.

### Service 3 - One on One Tutoring

New layouts, new features, and new passwords can make familiar tasks feel confusing. We work with you one on one to rebuild comfort with your computer. Email, web browsing, video calls, organizing files, using basic applications. We go step by step at a pace that feels right to you and we repeat things as often as needed.

### Service 4 - Cyber Security Guidance and Scam Awareness

Scam tactics and online threats keep changing. It is not realistic to expect anyone to keep track of all of them alone. We teach you how to recognize the most common dangers, how to respond when something looks suspicious, and how to use tools like password managers and multi factor authentication in ways that make sense for your life. Our goal is to reduce your anxiety about what is safe and what is not.

## 4. Our Promise and Approach

**Section heading**  
Support that stays steady, even when your screen does not

**Intro paragraph**  
You cannot control how technology will change next week. You can control who you turn to when those changes cause stress. Our promise is simple.

**Bulleted promises**  

- Calm, patient help. We explain things as many times as you need, without judgment or frustration.  
- Educational support, not just quick fixes. We want you to feel more comfortable and less anxious after we work together.  
- Clear expectations. We explain what we recommend, what we will do, and what it will cost before we start.  
- Local and personal. We are part of your community, not a distant call center. We take the time to understand your situation and your priorities.

**Reassurance line**  
You do not have to wait for a crisis. If your computer already feels unsettling or unfamiliar, that is a valid reason to reach out.

Use the testimonials exactly as written, with light formatting only.

**Imran**  

"Evan's great aptitude within the Cybersecurity domain as well as coupling this with his empathetic nature to help both customers and MSSPs/Partners with an aim to succeed really shown in his work with us.  
I would never hesitate hiring or having Evan in my team in the foreseeable future.  
A true asset for any company he works for."

**Robert**  

"Evan has helped our office tremendously. He built our network closet and installed a new security appliance "firewall" for our office. Evan set up new wiring throughout our office and centralized our wireless access. Currently, he is helping us to fully certify to PCI compliance. Evan is an incredible wealth of information and always makes suggestions that are beneficial to our office, but also cost effective. We highly recommend Evan and feel very fortunate to have found an IT professional that is talented, personable and very intelligent!"

**Gregory**  

"Evan is a talented engineer posessing excellent soft skills surpassing many peers in his line of work. Whether he was defusing tense situations with his technical skill and sense of humor, building strong relationships with what became long-term customers, or supporting his co-workers professionally and personally I was happy to have Evan as a colleague by my side for many years."

**Billy / Bill DeCarolis**  

"I have known Evan personally for over twenty years and have employed him professionally on and off for over ten years. Evan is a creative problem solver who knows how to find the solution that fits both the technical and budgetary requirements of his client. His breadth of knowledge makes him an ideal candidate for any IT group as he can cover a lot of ground and fill many roles on the fly. Evan works hard to stay current and I can always count on him to have a great understanding of the latest solutions.  

Beyond his professional capabilities and skills, I know Evan to be hard working and above all a trusted professional.  

Bill DeCarolis  
Chief Strategist - Big Deal Team Center of Excellence - NAMER  
Oracle Corporation"

**Molly**  

"IT professionals typically speak in terms not easily understood by those of us outside the field. It was my experience that Evan possesses a unique ability to explain complex IT issues in very simple terms (which, as a marketing director, is important to me). He was very eager to address my IT requests and would go out of his way to walk me through the process. I am more knowledgeable about how to integrate IT with marketing as a direct result of my interaction with Evan."

**Lars**  

"Deep knowledge on PCs and networks. Immediate reaction and solved our issues within time and cost. Great experience."

## 6. Simple Process Section

**Section heading**  
Here is how we bring clarity back to your day

**Step 1 - Tell us what you are experiencing**  
Call or email and describe what is happening in your own words. You do not need to know the technical names. We listen carefully and ask gentle questions to understand what you are seeing and how it feels.

**Step 2 - We agree on a plan and a price**  
We explain what we believe is going on, what we recommend, and what it will cost. We focus on solutions that match your needs and your comfort level, not on selling you the most expensive option.

**Step 3 - We stabilize, teach, and follow up**  
We do the work to stabilize your system and address the problems. We explain what changed and answer your questions. Afterward, we check in to make sure things still feel steady and that you are comfortable with the changes.
