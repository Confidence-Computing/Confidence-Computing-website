CONFIDENCE COMPUTING — BRAND GUIDE (v2)

Refined to match the new iconography, metallic palette addition, and service-card direction.

1. Brand Essence

Positioning:
Calm, premium technical service for everyday people. Cutting-edge intelligence paired with human warmth.
Technology feels chaotic; Confidence Computing provides steady light.

Core Metaphor:
The porch lamp — safety, guidance, clarity, and presence.

Voice Themes:
Warm. Reassuring. Competent. Never clinical. Never salesy.
You speak to people who are overwhelmed, not to experts.

2. Logo System
2.1 Primary Mark

Colonial lantern icon (R1 geometry, FL2 glow treatment) combined with uppercase wordmark CONFIDENCE COMPUTING.

2.2 Icon Rules

Stylized realism

Softened internal geometry, sharp outer silhouette

Glow-only interior (no bulb detail)

Visually readable at 16px to 2048px

Works in monochrome, duotone, or full-color warm glow

Primary placement: left-biased in horizontal lockups

2.3 Wordmark

Typeface: Between the two recommendations, your best fit is a modern Transitional serif with slightly softened terminals (99 percent confidence).
Characteristics:

Refined but not ornate

All-caps for strength and professionalism

Moderate contrast strokes for readability

Recommended families (all professional, license-friendly):

Playfair Display SC (Small Caps)

Cormorant Garamond SC

Libre Caslon Display

Sentinel SC (if using paid fonts)

3. Color System
3.1 Core Palette

Warm and calm, built around the lantern glow.

Name	Hex	Usage
Porch Glow	#F5C777	Icon interior, accent highlights
Warm Ember	#C48A3F	Secondary highlights, buttons
Harbor Blue	#0E1F32	Primary backgrounds
Dusk Slate	#1C2E40	Panels, overlays, gradients
Soft Ash	#D7D7D7	Light text on dark, subtle borders
Dark Iron (new metallic)	#4A4F57	Premium accents, frames, icon outlines

Metallic Guidance:
Dark Iron should appear as a brushed texture or subtle gradient, not flat grey. Never lighten beyond #5B6169 or it loses the premium tone.

4. Image Style Guide
4.1 Global Rules

Always warm-lit

Low contrast, soft edges

No text inside images

No harsh white light

Glows must feel tungsten, not LED

Blur backgrounds gently to mimic shallow depth of field

4.2 Hero Imagery

Warm dusk / porch-light scenes. Wide compositions. Negative space on right. Soft gradients.

4.3 Service Cards

Concepts should echo calm human presence with soft ambient light.

Repair/Tuning
Warm lamp, hands on laptop keys, soft reflections.

Backup/Recovery
Hands holding family photo album in amber lighting (memory metaphor).
Avoid direct copying from existing images.

Tutoring
Person reading tech book by firelight or lamplight.
Face optional. Atmosphere mandatory.

Security Coaching
Two people in conversation over a table lamp. Closed laptop between them.

5. Voice & Copy Standards
5.1 Headings

Declarative, calm sentences.
Examples:

“Technology changes. We help you stay steady.”

“Come in from the cold.”

“We bring calm to complicated days.”

5.5 Errors

Gentle clarity.

6. Layout & Components
6.1 Spacing
