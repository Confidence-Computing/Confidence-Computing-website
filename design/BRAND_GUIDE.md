## Name and Tagline

Business name:
- Confidence Computing

Working tagline options:
- "When your technology keeps changing, we help you stay steady"

## Color System (Conceptual)

Primary colors:

- Soft gray: stability and neutrality

- Warm amber or soft gold: clarity and gentle optimism
- Charcoal: grounding for text and key elements

Accent colors:

- Desaturated teal: trust and focus for buttons

These colors should appear as gentle gradients or flat fields with moderate contrast. Avoid stark black and bright neon.

## Typography

Suggested font types:

- Headings: a clean humanist sans serif such as Lato, Inter, or Source Sans
- Body text: the same family with a slightly lighter weight

Principles:

- Generous line height for readability
- Clear distinction between headings and body
- Underline links or give them a subtle color shift for clarity

## Voice and Style Checklist

- Use short sentences when possible
- Favor everyday words over technical language
- When technical words are necessary, pair them with a simple explanation
- Address the reader as "you" and speak as "we"
- Avoid exaggerations and hard selling
- Keep the tone steady and calm even when describing problems

Example phrases:

- "It is normal to feel this way"
- "You do not have to handle this alone"
- "We will walk through it together"
- "Here is what we recommend and why"
