# Imagery and Metaphor Guide

This guide explains how to express the "shifting weather" theme visually without falling into literal or cliched weather imagery.

## Emotional Targets for Imagery

Each visual on the site should support:

- A sense of calm after change
- Relief after confusion
- Warmth and human presence
- Stability in the middle of motion

Images should not amplify fear. They should validate that technology is chaotic while making the viewer feel supported and less alone.

## What To Evoke

Use imagery that suggests:

- Gentle transitions from clutter to clarity
- Overlapping digital elements settling into place
- Everyday home or small office environments lit with soft, natural light
- Human scale workspaces: a simple desk, a laptop, a warm mug, a comfortable chair

Visual metaphors for shifting conditions can include:

- Soft gradients that move from muted to slightly brighter tones
- Blurry or out of focus digital elements that become sharp and clear
- A subtle split image where the left side feels chaotic and the right side feels ordered

## What To Avoid

Do not use:

- Literal storm imagery such as rain, lightning, or dark clouds
- Lighthouses, lanterns, or maritime visuals
- Highly technical visuals full of code, complex graphs, or server racks
- Cold, harsh, or overly futuristic color palettes
- Cartoonish icons that feel childish or overly playful

## Style Notes

- Prefer photographs or realistic illustrations over flat cartoons
- Keep compositions simple and uncluttered
- Use warm white balance to communicate comfort and safety
- Limit the number of visual elements in each frame to avoid overwhelming the viewer

## Color Direction

Colors should feel like the calm part of the day after conditions have changed, not like the height of a storm.

Suggested tones:

- Soft grays for stability
- Muted steel or slate blues for calm
- Gentle sunrise golds or soft ambers for clarity
- Warm beige or light tan for human comfort

Contrasts should be gentle, not harsh. Avoid neon tones or very high saturation.

## Iconography

Icons should be simple line or flat icons that represent:

- Stability (check marks, simple shields)
- Communication (speech bubbles, phone and email symbols)
- Devices (laptops, simple monitors, tablets)

They should not:

- Include aggressive warning symbols unless truly needed
- Mimic weather icons such as clouds or raindrops
- Feel corporate or generic where possible
