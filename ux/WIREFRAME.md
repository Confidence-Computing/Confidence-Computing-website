2. Hero section
3. Problem and empathy section
4. Services section

The layout should be scroll friendly and readable on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## 1. Header

- Right: phone number and a small button "Call for help"
- Background: solid or subtle gradient

The header can remain fixed at the top to keep contact details available.

## 2. Hero Section

- Full width block
- Left column: headline, subheading, short support line, buttons
- Right column: imagery that suggests shifting technology becoming calm and clear

Buttons:

- Primary: "Talk to someone who understands"
- Secondary: "Tell us what is happening"

## 3. Problem and Empathy Section

- Narrower width for comfortable reading
- Heading: "When your computer feels unpredictable"
- One or two paragraphs of copy, then bullet list of relatable questions

Visual idea:

- A subtle visual with overlapping windows or vague clutter to the side

## 4. Services Section

- Light icon for each service

Services:

- Repairs, tune ups, and replacements
- Data backup and recovery
- One on one tutoring

## 5. Promise and Approach Section

- Single column with a heading like "Support that stays steady, even when your screen does not"
- Short intro and a bullet list of promises
- Optional small side highlight: "Serving Oxford and surrounding communities"

## 6. Testimonials

- Carousel or stacked cards
- Each testimonial clearly labeled by name
- Longer testimonials can be expandable or scrollable on mobile

The goal is to communicate that multiple kinds of people have trusted and appreciated Evan's help.

## 7. Simple Process Section

- Visual step layout (1, 2, 3)
- Each step has a short heading and two to three lines of text
- Steps should feel easy, not bureaucratic

Example headings:

- "Tell us what you are experiencing"
- "We agree on a plan and price"
- "We stabilize and follow up"

## 8. Final Call to Action and Footer

- Strong but gentle invitation to reach out
- Repeat contact details
