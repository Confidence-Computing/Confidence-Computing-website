# TACHES Framework - Confidence Computing

This document captures the TACHES style thinking for the Confidence Computing site.

## T - Target and Trouble

**Primary audience**

- Non technical home users in and around Oxford, Massachusetts
- Often older adults or people who did not grow up with computers
- People who feel anxious that they might click the wrong thing, lose photos, or break something

**Secondary audience**

- Very small offices and local businesses that need a trusted technology person without a full time hire

**Core troubles**

- Their computer feels unpredictable: sometimes it works, sometimes it misbehaves for no clear reason
- Updates move buttons, change layouts, or introduce new requests they do not understand
- Scam popups and warnings are confusing and scary
- They worry about losing irreplaceable photos, documents, or emails
- They do not know who to trust and often feel talked down to by technical support people

The emotional truth: people do not call because of a specific error message. They call because they feel overwhelmed and outmatched by technology that keeps changing around them.

## A - Atmosphere and Attitude

The site must feel:

- Calm, grounded, and human
- Local and neighborly, not corporate
- Reassuring and non judgmental
- Competent without arrogance

Technology is presented as something that behaves like New England weather. It shifts often and rarely waits for people to be ready. Confidence Computing is the steady, patient presence that helps people through those changes.

Tone is plain spoken, friendly, and clear. Jargon is avoided or explained in simple language.

## C - Core Content

The site should focus on a small set of key messages:

- We understand how overwhelming changing technology feels
- We specialize in helping you when your computer behaves in unpredictable ways
- We protect what matters most to you, such as photos and documents
- We teach and guide at your pace, so you feel supported throughout
- We are local, reachable, and transparent about what we do and what it costs

Content building blocks:

- Hero statement about staying steady when technology keeps changing
- A relatable description of the problems customers face
- A clear list of services expressed in human terms
- A promise about how Confidence Computing works with people
- Testimonials that prove the approach
- A simple three step process
- Clear contact information and soft but firm calls to action

## H - Hierarchy and Layout

The initial site will likely be a single page. The suggested order is:

1. Hero - who we are and why we exist
2. Problem and empathy section - how it feels when technology keeps changing
3. Services overview - what we do in clear language
4. Why people trust us - how we work, what makes us different
5. Testimonials - real voices from people who needed help
6. Simple process steps - how working with us feels
7. Contact and call to action - phone, email, simple form

This order mirrors the emotional journey of the visitor:

confused → recognized → informed → reassured → convinced → ready to reach out

## E - Experience and Actions

Primary action: call or email to describe what is happening.

Secondary actions:

- Request a call back through a simple form
- Ask a question through email without needing to know the correct terminology

The experience should tell visitors:

- You do not have to diagnose the problem yourself
- You do not have to know the right words before you reach out
- You are not wasting our time by asking basic questions

CTAs should emphasize relief and support rather than urgency or self reliance.

Examples:

- "Talk to someone who understands what you are going through"
- "Tell us what is happening in your own words"
- "Get calm, patient help"

## S - Style and Specifics

Stylistic principles:

- Relatable metaphors tied to New England weather and shifting conditions, used gently
- Short paragraphs and meaningful headings
- Bullet lists for services and symptoms
- No fear tactics and no condescending language
- Colors and imagery that evoke calm after change rather than dramatic storms

The metaphor of shifting weather should be felt in the language and visuals, not shouted. The visitor should sense that technology is naturally chaotic and that Confidence Computing is intentionally steady.
